# WebGame

### This is a tetris clone run using webassembly. There are basic controls to rotate the piece and move it side to side with basic collision detection and a line clearing function.

## How it works

### I am writing the logic for this program in c++ and compiling it to webassembly. This allows the game to run faster than runnin it in javaScript. I am rendering the graphics in WebGL and using custom input/output functions to transfer information from the wasm modules to the WebGL.
