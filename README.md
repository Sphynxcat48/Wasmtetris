# WebGame

### This is a tetris clone run using webassembly. There are basic controls to rotate the piece and move it side to side with basic colision detection and a line clearing function.

## How it works

### I am writing the logic for this program in c++ and compiling it to webassembly. This allows the game to run faster and natively on your computer. I am rendering the graphics in JavaScript and using a series of if statements to get informatin to the JavaScript files.
